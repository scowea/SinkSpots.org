        <h1 class="pagetitle">DIY Boat Chop.</h1>
<i>Disclaimer: PS Composites, Murky Water, and only a handful of other shadowy figures in the world are master chop mysters... someone more qualified than i could certainly do a way better job all around.. i really recommend you go to them. if you want it to turn our sweet and save yourself alot of hassel, just go to one of them and get a float chop.

Im not suggesting the process described below is the right way to do it, or the best way, or even how it is supposed to be done.. but a few of us in the PNW have tried to perform this "center line chop" in one variation or another.<br><br>

In a way, the cuttting is the easy and fast part, although i wouldnt say its easy because ive never picked up a grinder before.. prep work, measuring, safety meetings and consulting with your fellow realm hogs, re-measuring, reconsidering this whole endevor over beers, measuring again  and re-seaming would the difficult part. its all hard. god bless our boat builders.
Proceed at your own risk.. hopefully u wont destroy your boat.

      <h2>Step 1: Sand your seams down to the glass</h2>
      First thing your going to need is alot of beer... and maybe a few friends to stand around and watch and drink your beer while offering witty comments and suggestions. once you have that support system in place, then you can get to the manual labor. why sand off the black epoxy off the seams?
      Two reasons, <br>1. so you can mark directly on the glass with a black pen, and <br> 2. you going to have to redo the outside seams anyway so you have to clean up the surface..
      <br><br>
      i put down masking tape as a guide so i wouldnt eat into the deck or hull too much. i used the old fashioned method and it took an hour, but an electric sander or grinder with a sanding wheel on it would be way faster and easier..

      <h2>Step 2: measure and mark your cut</h2>
      the first cut will be down the middle of the seam. i used a piece of caulk to draw it first, then a red sharpy.

depending on how and what you are trying to trim and what your looking for, you may have different strategies...some take some over all volume out, or more on the stern side or more on the bow side. you have to measure and mark your cuts. dont fuck it up. mystery moves are awesome so be careful.<br><br>
my bow is a bit high, and without a weight in front of my feet and a little bit of water in it, i cant really drop the bow on command. too much west virginia chop. so i started at the back of the cockpit, and went up to almost the center of the footbumps for the length of the cut
<br>it was a 4 foot section total. so 1 foot of taper, to a 2 foot section, then another 1 foot taper.

the tapered section is a 1 foot, very narrow triangle that you will cut out... one on either side. then the middle section is a 2 foot retangle of material that will get cut out. this isnt going to work if you start with a full cut and your trying to get this to sink for a 100lbs person, only more minor trim cuts would this technique work...at some point you may have to just cut it all the way apart but i want to avoid that, because getting the boat back together it a bit more complicated and a pain in the ass.

we started by cutting the center line...

i decided i wanted to take 1/2 inch of material out total. so from the center line cut, i measured 1/4 inch up on the deck, and 1/4 inch down on to the hull.. making a mark every couple inches, with the 1 foot taper on either end going from 1/4 inch tapered down to zero at the very end of the center line cut. 
<br><br>Then i took some ribbon masking tape and connected the dots. We then took a red sharpy and coolered in the middle inside of the masking tape, so we could clearly see that any glass with sharpy on it should be cut out. pulling the masking tape back off, there was a clean line where we will cut.

now its time for the second and last cut. break out the grinder with the cutting wheel and go for it. i let ryan cut my boat since i have no experience with the grinder and he has alot... its delicate work, one slip of the hand and you will cut through glass like a ninja star through butter. thanks for not scewing it up ryan, you did a good job. other folks have used a jig saw instead.
