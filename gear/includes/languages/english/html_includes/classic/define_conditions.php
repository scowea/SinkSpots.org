<p>Dirt Bag Kayaker: "What gives dude, did SinkSpots sell out? why cant i get free stickers anymore?"</p>


<p>Answer: If you think we are getting rich selling stickers and t-shirts to the small community of squirt boaters across the country, your kidding yourself. 

<br><br>It takes a bit of money every year to keep a website on the internet, and we are just trying to break even for once... we are dirt bag kayakers too. <br><br>So you can feel good in your heart that you are supporting the squirt boating community, by helping keep this valuable mysterymove resource available to everyone. Thanks Friends!</p>
