         <p> 
  This is a publicly maintained, interactive archive of mystery move spots. You 
  can add your own spots... whether they be epic, a local spot your dialing in, 
  or even a exploratory spot that you think would be good but never got a chance 
  to sink at yet... <br>
  <br>
  Assign your mystery spot the appropriate USGS Gage# for the river, and the min 
  and max levels that your local spot is good at... this site will quickly tell 
  you if it's running or not. If it's an exploration spot, add a journal entry 
  to remind your self what a good or bad level was... as a tool to help dial in 
  fickle spots. <br>
  <br>
  Squirt boating and the knowledge of mystery moves seems to be mostly word of 
  mouth... by squirt boaters, good friends and companions. It's a small subculture 
  of the kayaking community, that is unique to experience and hard to explain. 
  SinkSpots can be a place for that local knowledge to be preserved...and will 
  hopefully let the knowledge live on and grow, and be a valueable tool for traveling 
  sinkers passing through your local area looking for some downtime.</p>
<p>This is a public information share... feel free to change any information if 
  you see that it is incorrect.</p><br>

Imagine how good you will feel, by helping to offest the cost of keeping this website on the internet.<br>

        Squirt boating is an inherently dangerous sport due to: the real possibility 
        of pinning, the difficulty of wet exits, etc. "Exploring" new spots should 
        never be attempted by anyone other than veteran squirt boaters, and should 
        be approached with EXTREME caution. How you use the information contained 
        in the pages of this site, is totally your responsibility, as you are 
        taking your own life into your own hands. Myself or anyone involved with 
        this site will not be held responsible, and are not liable for any injuries
